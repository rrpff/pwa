# Progressive Web App in React

Aiming to build a tidy, fast progressive web app with React to establish some effective boundaries for a framework/toolkit.

_It's not supposed to be any good yet._

## Features

- [x] Client side rendering
- [x] Server side rendering
- [x] Routing with history API
- [x] Code splitting
- [x] Dependency injection for components
- [x] Service worker caching
- [x] Retrieve data when rendering pages
- [ ] Retrieve data using props when rendering pages
- [ ] Use [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/overview)
- [ ] Figure out a better way of fetching data for rendering. Embedding queries in components is pretty lame.
- [ ] Handle UI and network events changing state (probably redux + sagas, but blue sky thinking needed here.)
- [ ] Client side hot reloading
- [ ] Server side hot reloading
- [ ] Consider https://github.com/thejameskyle/react-loadable
- [ ] Consider https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin
- [ ] Consider how HOCs factor into this design
- [ ] Webpack optimisation (clean plugin, dedupe, etc)
- [ ] https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist
- [ ] ...?
- [ ] Create reasonable boundaries between all elements
- [ ] Package it up
